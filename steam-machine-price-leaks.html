            <h2>Valve’s Living Room Return: Leaked Prices for the New "Steam Machine" Stir Hardware Community</h2>
            <p class="date">January 20, 2026</p>

            <p><strong>BELLEVUE, WA</strong> — Following its high-profile announcement in late 2025, Valve’s revival of the Steam Machine ecosystem has moved from "hype" to "heated debate" as retail leaks suggest a significantly higher price tag than many fans anticipated. The device, a sleek 6-inch cube designed for 4K living room setups, is slated for an early 2026 release.</p>

            <h3>The Pricing Breakdown</h3>
            <p>While Valve has not officially listed an MSRP, recent leaks from European retailers—specifically the Czech site Smarty.cz—have provided the first concrete look at potential costs:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>512GB Base Model:</strong> Estimated $799 – $850 USD</li>
                <li><strong>2TB High-Capacity Model:</strong> Estimated $950 – $1,070 USD</li>
                <li><strong>Steam Controller (Standalone):</strong> Rumored at $79 – $99 USD</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Analysts point out that European prices often include VAT and import duties. Insiders like Linus Tech Tips predict a U.S. starting price closer to $699, positioning it against the PlayStation 5 Pro.</p>

            <h3>Technical Specifications</h3>
            <p>Valve is marketing the unit as "faster than 70% of gaming PCs" on Steam. The "Cube" utilizes a semi-custom AMD Zen 4 processor (6-Core) and AMD RDNA 3 graphics with 8GB dedicated VRAM. It runs SteamOS 3, offering a "Console Mode" and a "Desktop Mode" (KDE Plasma).</p>

            <h3>Market Reaction: Console or PC?</h3>
            <p>The pricing has created a divide. While more expensive than a standard Xbox or PS5, it offers a "no-compromise" PC architecture in a shell smaller than a toaster. Valve’s goal is a "middle ground" strategy: plug-and-play ease for existing Steam libraries without "walled garden" restrictions.</p>
