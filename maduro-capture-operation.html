            <h2>Operation Absolute Resolve: U.S. Special Forces Capture Nicolás Maduro in Caracas Raid</h2>
            <p class="date">January 20, 2026</p>

            <p><strong>NEW YORK CITY</strong> — Following a daring and unprecedented military operation in the early hours of January 3, former Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and First Lady Cilia Flores are currently in U.S. custody in New York. The capture, branded by the Venezuelan government as a "kidnapping," marks the first time a sitting head of state has been forcibly removed by U.S. forces since the 1989 invasion of Panama.</p>

            <h3>The Legal Justification</h3>
            <p>The U.S. Department of Justice, led by Attorney General Pam Bondi, cited a long-standing federal indictment as the basis for the operation. Key legal reasons for the arrest include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Narco-Terrorism:</strong> Allegations that Maduro led the "Cartel of the Suns," trafficking cocaine into the U.S.</li>
                <li><strong>Foreign Terrorist Designation:</strong> In 2025, the Trump administration designated several Venezuelan entities as Foreign Terrorist Organizations (FTOs).</li>
                <li><strong>Bounty:</strong> The State Department had previously increased the reward for Maduro’s capture to $50 million.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Current Status & Global Reaction</h3>
            <p>The aftermath has created a massive diplomatic crisis. In Venezuela, Vice President Delcy Rodríguez was sworn in as acting president on January 5. While she maintains that Maduro is the legitimate leader, she has begun engaging in "new political moments" regarding prisoner releases.</p>

            <p>In the U.S., Maduro pleaded not guilty in a Manhattan federal court on January 5 and is currently held in high-security detention. Internationally, reactions are split; while the UK supports a democratic transition, Mexico and Brazil have condemned the raid as a violation of sovereignty.</p>
