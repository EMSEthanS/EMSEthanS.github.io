            <p>In the world of artificial intelligence, few tools have generated as much awe and visceral pushback as Sora, OpenAI’s text-to-video model. Since its first preview in early 2024, Sora has evolved from a laboratory marvel into a public social platform, leaving a trail of industry panic, viral memes, and deep-seated ethical debates in its wake.</p>

            <h3>A Brief History: From "GPT-1 Moment" to Sora 2</h3>
            <p>The history of Sora is often described in technical "epochs."</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>February 15, 2024 (The Preview):</strong> OpenAI stunned the world by releasing HD clips of a woman walking through Tokyo. It was hailed as the "GPT-1 moment" for video—proof that video could be generated from text.</li>
                <li><strong>December 9, 2024 (Initial Public Release):</strong> Released to Plus and Pro users, Sora struggled with physics; famously, basketballs would disappear through hoops or people would grow extra limbs mid-stride.</li>
                <li><strong>September 30, 2025 (Sora 2):</strong> OpenAI launched Sora 2, the "GPT-3.5 moment." This version introduced stable physics and a social app where users could remix videos and use "Cameos."</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Popular Moments: The Viral and the Weird</h3>
            <p>The internet quickly gravitated toward the surreal with the Sora 2 release:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The "Stephen Hawking" Memes:</strong> Viral clips of Hawking in "Robot Wars" style battles or doing skateboarding tricks became massive hits on TikTok.</li>
                <li><strong>The Jake Paul Controversy:</strong> Satirical videos of Paul in "effeminate clothing" led to legal threats, highlighting the realism of these deepfakes.</li>
                <li><strong>The "Liar’s Dividend":</strong> Realistic clips, like a fake cat fight, led to the phenomenon where real footage is doubted because AI fakes are indistinguishable.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Controversies: "Forgiveness Over Permission"</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>The Hollywood Reckoning:</strong> Tyler Perry halted an $800 million studio expansion after seeing Sora. The MPA and CAA have accused OpenAI of stealing intellectual property.</li>
                <li><strong>The MLK Crisis:</strong> After disrespectful depictions of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., OpenAI was forced to implement a reactive "opt-out" policy for historical estates.</li>
                <li><strong>The "Watermark" War:</strong> Mandatory watermarks were introduced, but third-party tools to remove them appeared within seven days, rendering the safety feature largely ineffective.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Better or Worse?</h3>
            <p>To supporters, Sora democratizes filmmaking. To critics—like those at <em>Vox</em> who dubbed it an "unholy abomination"—it represents the end of human-led creativity. One thing remains certain: the "sky" (the meaning of Sora in Japanese) is the new battlefield for digital ethics.</p>
