        <p>In the world of artificial intelligence, few tools have generated as much awe and visceral pushback as Sora, OpenAI’s text-to-video model. Since its first preview in early 2024, Sora has evolved from a laboratory marvel into a public social platform, leaving a trail of industry panic, viral memes, and deep-seated ethical debates in its wake.</p>

        <h3>A Brief History: From "GPT-1 Moment" to Sora 2</h3>
        <p>The history of Sora is often described in technical "epochs."</p>
        <p><strong>February 15, 2024 (The Preview):</strong> OpenAI first stunned the world by releasing high-definition clips of a woman walking through a neon-lit Tokyo and a "short fluffy monster" next to a candle. At the time, OpenAI called this the "GPT-1 moment" for video—an initial proof of concept that video could be generated from simple text.</p>
        <p><strong>December 9, 2024 (Initial Public Release):</strong> After months of "red teaming" (safety testing), Sora was released to ChatGPT Plus and Pro users in the US and Canada. It was capable of one-minute videos but struggled with physics; famously, a basketball might disappear through a hoop or a person might grow an extra limb mid-stride.</p>
        <p><strong>September 30, 2025 (Sora 2 and the Social App):</strong> OpenAI launched "Sora 2," which they hailed as the "GPT-3.5 moment." This version introduced far more stable physics (e.g., accurately modeling buoyancy and gravity) and launched alongside a dedicated social app. For the first time, users could remix each other’s videos, follow creators, and even insert themselves into videos using a feature called "Cameos."</p>

        <h3>Popular Moments: The Viral and the Weird</h3>
        <p>Sora’s impact on internet culture was immediate. While some users used it for breathtaking cinematic landscapes, the internet quickly gravitated toward the surreal:</p>
        <p><strong>The "Stephen Hawking" Memes:</strong> Shortly after the Sora 2 release, AI-generated videos of historical and public figures doing absurd things went viral. Clips of Stephen Hawking in a "Robot Wars" style battle or doing skateboarding tricks became massive hits on platforms like Reddit and TikTok.</p>
        <p><strong>The Jake Paul Controversy:</strong> In late 2025, a wave of Sora-generated videos showed influencer Jake Paul in "effeminate clothing" and satirical scenarios. Paul jokingly threatened legal action in a viral video, highlighting how realistic the "deepfakes" had become.</p>
        <p><strong>The "Liar’s Dividend":</strong> Many users initially fell for Sora videos, such as a realistic clip of a cat fight that appeared to be street-shot footage. This led to a phenomenon experts call the "liar’s dividend," where even real footage is doubted because AI fakes are so indistinguishable.</p>

        <h3>Controversies: "Forgiveness Over Permission"</h3>
        <p>The tool's rise has not been without significant backlash, particularly regarding its "move fast and break things" approach.</p>
        <p><strong>1. The Hollywood Reckoning:</strong> Perhaps the most significant blowback came from the film industry. Producer Tyler Perry famously halted an $800 million expansion of his Atlanta studio after seeing Sora’s capabilities, fearing for the future of physical production. The Motion Picture Association (MPA) and Creative Artists Agency (CAA) have accused OpenAI of "art washing" and stealing intellectual property to train its models.</p>
        <p><strong>2. The MLK and Historical Figure Crisis:</strong> OpenAI originally allowed users to generate videos of deceased historical figures. This led to what many called a "distasteful" flood of videos, including disrespectful depictions of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Elvis Presley. Following a public plea from the King Estate and a wave of "disrespectful deepfakes," OpenAI was forced to "pull the plug" on several historical figure generations and implement a reactive "opt-out" policy for estates.</p>
        <p><strong>3. Copyright and The "Watermark" War:</strong> Sora 2 was launched with a mandatory "moving watermark" to distinguish AI from reality. However, within seven days of the app’s release, reports emerged that third-party tools to remove these watermarks had become prevalent, rendering the safety feature largely ineffective and sparking renewed calls for government regulation like the NO FAKES Act.</p>

        <h3>Better or Worse?</h3>
        <p>Today, Sora sits at a crossroads. To its supporters, it is a tool that democratizes filmmaking, allowing anyone with an idea to create a Hollywood-standard scene. To its critics—like those at Vox who famously dubbed Sora 2 an "unholy abomination"—it represents the end of human-led creativity and a "post-truth era" where video evidence can no longer be trusted.</p>
        <p>As Sora continues to expand globally, reaching markets in South America and Asia in 2026, the conversation has shifted from "what can it do?" to "how can we live with it?" One thing remains certain: the "sky" (the meaning of Sora in Japanese) is no longer the limit—it's the new battlefield for digital ethics.</p>
