        <p>This Newsletter goes over several modern topics and events, all ranging in genre, type, and date. This is all generated using an AI which scans hundreds of articles in order to get accurate and believable information, even on matters which are speculation.</p>

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi, I'm Ethan Stonecipher, a student in the CAH 205 class. We're going over the possibilities with AI and the applications they have, and I thought the best one by far was the research possibilities they can possess. With AI, we can stay informed about modern events at a significantly faster rate then manual research.</p>
