            <h2>Minneapolis Reeling After Federal Agent Fatally Shoots Observer During Immigration Operation</h2>
            <p class="date">January 20, 2026</p>

            <p><strong>MINNEAPOLIS</strong> — Tensions in the Twin Cities have reached a breaking point following the January 7 killing of Renee Nicole Good, a 37-year-old mother of three and U.S. citizen, by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent.</p>

            <p>The shooting took place around 9:30 a.m. at East 34th Street and Portland Avenue. Federal agents were conducting a targeted immigration sweep when they encountered Good, who was reportedly acting as a community observer or "legal observer."</p>

            <h3>The Incident</h3>
            <p>According to eyewitnesses and social media footage, Good’s vehicle was stopped in the street, appearing to observe federal vehicles. Agents approached the car aggressively; one attempted to pull the driver’s door open while shouting commands.</p>
            
            <blockquote>
                "That’s fine, dude... I’m not mad at you," Good is heard saying in video footage just seconds before the shooting.
            </blockquote>

            <p>As she began to drive away, an agent fired multiple shots through the driver's side window. Good was later pronounced dead at Hennepin County Medical Center from a gunshot wound to the head.</p>

            <h3>Local Outcry and Investigation</h3>
            <p>Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey and Governor Tim Walz have criticized the federal narrative, citing video evidence that suggests Good was driving away and posed no immediate threat. The investigation is currently a point of friction; while local authorities initially planned a joint probe, the FBI has since taken exclusive control.</p>
