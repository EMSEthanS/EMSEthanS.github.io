                <p><strong>Witness Video and Court Documents Refute Federal Narrative in Fatal Minneapolis Shooting</strong></p>
                
                <p><strong>MINNEAPOLIS — Jan. 25, 2026</strong> — The fatal shooting of Alex Pretti, a 37-year-old ICU nurse, by federal agents on Saturday morning has ignited a firestorm of controversy as bystander video and eyewitness testimony appear to directly contradict the official account provided by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).</p>

                <h3>The Incident</h3>
                <p>The shooting occurred on <strong>Saturday, January 24, 2026, around 9:00 a.m.</strong> near 26th Street and Nicollet Avenue during what DHS described as a "targeted operation." Alex Pretti, a U.S. citizen and nurse at the Minneapolis VA Medical Center, was present at the scene observing the federal activity.</p>
                
                <p>According to multiple bystander videos, the confrontation began when a federal agent shoved a female observer to the ground. Pretti appeared to intervene to help the woman, at which point he was pepper-sprayed and tackled by at least six agents. While pinned to the ground, Pretti was shot approximately 10 times in five seconds. He was pronounced dead at the scene.</p>

                <h3>The Perpetrators and Official Claims</h3>
                <p>The shooting involved U.S. Border Patrol agents, with Border Patrol Commander Greg Bovino confirming that the primary shooter is an eight-year veteran of the agency. DHS Secretary Kristi Noem and other administration officials initially labeled Pretti a "domestic terrorist" and a "gunman" who approached officers while brandishing a 9mm handgun. They argued the agents acted in self-defense to prevent a "massacre."</p>

                <h3>The Evidence: Video and Witnesses</h3>
                <p>The federal narrative has been met with sharp criticism from state officials and eyewitnesses:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Video Analysis:</strong> High-resolution footage verified by news outlets shows Pretti holding a cellphone, not a gun, in the moments before he was tackled. One specific video angle appears to show an agent in a gray jacket reaching into the scuffle, removing a handgun from Pretti’s waistband, and stepping away—immediately after which other agents opened fire on the now-disarmed man.</li>
                    <li><strong>Witness Testimony:</strong> In sworn affidavits, witnesses described Pretti as "helping" rather than resisting. One witness, a children's entertainer who was five feet away, testified that Pretti had his hands raised before being tackled.</li>
                    <li><strong>Medical Oversight:</strong> A local physician who attempted to render aid testified that agents initially blocked them. When finally allowed to approach, the physician noted that agents were not performing CPR but instead "appeared to be counting his bullet wounds." Pretti reportedly suffered at least three wounds to his back.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Legal and Political Fallout</h3>
                <p>Governor Tim Walz called the DHS account "nonsense" after reviewing the footage. Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara confirmed that Pretti was a lawful gun owner with a permit to carry and had no criminal record. A federal judge has since issued a temporary restraining order barring DHS from altering or destroying any evidence related to the case. This is the third shooting involving federal agents in Minneapolis this month, further straining the relationship between local authorities and the federal immigration crackdown.</p>
