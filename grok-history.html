        <h2>Grok: Key Notes and History Up to Now</h2>
        <p class="author">By Ethan Stonecipher</p>

        <div class="article-body">
            <p>Grok is an AI developed by Elon Musk’s company, xAI. It was announced in November 2023 and was designed to be a more "edgy" and "sarcastic" alternative to other AI models like ChatGPT. One of its primary advantages is its real-time access to information via the X (formerly Twitter) platform, allowing it to stay updated on breaking news faster than many of its competitors.</p>

            <p>In March 2024, xAI made the significant move of open-sourcing the base weights of Grok-1, the model behind the AI. This allowed researchers and developers to see how the model was built and to build their own versions of it, which was a major step in the ongoing debate about open-source vs. closed-source AI development.</p>

            <p>Throughout its short history, Grok has been at the center of several discussions regarding AI bias and accuracy. While it has been praised for its ability to handle complex queries and its unique personality, it has also faced criticism for instances of hallucination and the way it interprets controversial topics. Despite this, it remains a key player in the AI landscape, particularly for users of the X platform.</p>
